	<p class="mainText">Jobs's design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism. In India, he experienced Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey,[237] and his sense of intuition was influenced by the spiritual people with whom he studied.[237] He also learned from many references and sources, such as modernist architectural style of Joseph Eichler,[citation needed] and the industrial designs of Richard Sapper[238] and Dieter Rams.</p>
